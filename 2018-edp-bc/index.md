    - Are these Tokyo-Tech Specific (therefore Useless) Methods?
        - Short answer: Absolutely NOT.
            - Design Thinking is relatively new method , not well defined, and not widely spreaded yet.
            - They are not Tokyo-Tech specific (see below).
                - Many companies and ex-students are using our methods.
        - Encourage to google in ENGLISH!! ( Tokyo-Tech has dominated search results in Japanese 🙄 )
            - [![Image](https://gyazo.com/bda8b482922d0f21349ccaa45070a038/thumb/1000)](https://gyazo.com/bda8b482922d0f21349ccaa45070a038)
        - IMPORTANT: We are interested in not ”Design Thinking" methods but rather "Engineering Design" methods.
        - Originally, Saito-sensei was a visiting researcher of Stanfod and he brought its ME310 and d.school design methods to EDP.
        - Tokyo-Tech and IDEO Tokyo created the initial educational materials for "Design Thinking Fundamental" course.
        - Why Stanford and IDEO?
            - [![Image](https://gyazo.com/00d1d9b527986a371380b3b2c5005b48/thumb/1000)](https://gyazo.com/00d1d9b527986a371380b3b2c5005b48)

        - Every year, the faculty team is improving the materials in accordance with the situation of EDP .
            - Especially Tokyo-Tech students are not good at creating POVs. 🤔
            - ASIDE: I (Kado) DO NOT LIKE affinity-diagram and brainstorming both are famous for "Design Thinking". 😣
        - We know that "Referenceability" matters. 🔎

    - DESIGN YOUR DESIGN RPOCESS !!
        - We think our methods are NOT the best or one-fit-all perfect one.
        - There are various kinds of themes in EDP-B/C.
        - So, we encourage you to "Design Your Design Process" specific to your theme.
            - 守破離（DTF, EDP-A, and EDP-B/C <- now here)
        - Double Diamond:
            - EDP-B is for "define strategy" and EDP-C is for "execute solution"
