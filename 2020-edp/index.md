This lecture restricts the number of students based on the maximum number of project groups. The enrollment of the following students will be preferentially accepted.

1. Students in Engineering and Science Design Course and CBEC Program. (Students who do not belong to these categories may contact with the instructors in advance to ask for the vacancy.)
2. Students who are willing to practice "empathizing with users through producing prototypes" and "overcoming the diversity of students with different backgrounds." These are evaluated by enrollment experiences of the related courses and interviews with the instructors.
