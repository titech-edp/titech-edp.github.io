## Prerequisites
This lecture restricts the number of students based on the maximum number of project groups. The enrollment of the following students will be preferentially accepted.
1. Students in Engineering and Science Design Course and CBEC Program. (Students who do not belong to these categories may contact with the instructors in advance to ask for the vacancy.)
2. Students who are willing to practice "empathizing with users through producing prototypes" and "overcoming the diversity of students with different backgrounds." These are evaluated by enrollment experiences of the related courses and interviews with the instructors.

    - DO NOT USE text-based private messaging tools (e.g., Slack DM, LINE, Skype)
    - Encourage to use video chat tools (e.g., LINE, Skype, Zoom)
    - This course deals harshly with your absent/late/early-leaving, because team dynamics matters the most.
        - As we discuss later, prior report on slack `#zzz-im-late` reduces the penalty.
- Personal Report
- Final Artifacts as a Team
    - 5P (Product, Process, Plot (Movie),  Poster, Pitch)
- (optional) Blog
    - I'm planning to give an assignment of report as blog.
